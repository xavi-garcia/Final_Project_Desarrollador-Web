# Final_Project_Desarrollador-Web
This is the final porject for the Web Development course in CoderHouse. It is a website about art. 

If you wish to see this project, you can clone the repository on your local terminal and then run it.

I've used:

*Bootstrap v5.1 to add some styles and formatting options.
*Sass for organising my stylesheets.
